Pharo is a live programming environment. Compiling a method installs it into the
running image immediately — no restart, no recompile step. Postern exposes that
capability over HTTP: a server on `localhost:8422` accepts Smalltalk expressions,
executes them in the live image, and returns the result. Any outside
tool — Claude Code, a CI job, a shell script — can drive the full development
cycle without touching the Pharo GUI.

Zero Claude SDK dependency.

**Platforms:** macOS, Linux (Pharo 12)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/punt-labs/postern.git
cd postern
make setup    # downloads Pharo 12 VM + image, loads all Postern packages
make start    # launches Pharo GUI with eval server on port 8422
```

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8422/health    # → ok
curl -s http://localhost:8422/help     # → self-documenting table of contents
```

## The live image model

Most language environments store code as files. An agent editing Python, Go, or
TypeScript writes to files, a compiler processes them, and the runtime loads the
result — typically requiring a process restart before new code can execute.

Pharo stores code in a live object graph called an image. Compiling a method
installs it into that graph immediately. The same session can define a class,
call a method on it, run its tests, and inspect the live objects it creates —
all without a restart. Each of those steps happens in the running process.

For agent-driven coding this tightens the loop at every increment. After sending
a compile request, the agent can call the new method in the next request, observe
the real runtime result, and branch on it — not on a static type check or a test
run that spawned a subprocess. When the increment is complete, Iceberg (Pharo's
git integration) runs inside the same image, so the agent can commit without
leaving the session.

Postern's role is to make that image accessible to tools that speak HTTP.

## Coding Agents + Pharo

Any coding agent that can make HTTP requests and follow instructions can drive the
full TDD cycle. The agent sends Smalltalk to `/repl` and reads `/help` to learn the
image's API, conventions, and safety rules. From there it drives define → compile →
test → commit without leaving its session. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and any
other agent that speaks HTTP all work the same way.

The `/help` endpoint is the interface contract between an external agent and the
image. A session that has never seen the image before reads `/help` first and uses
those nine sections to navigate correctly:

| Section | What it documents |
|---------|-------------------|
| `/help/api` | Eval server protocol: endpoints, auth, request/response format |
| `/help/pharo` | Pharo 12 standards: fluid class syntax, protocols, JSON pattern |
| `/help/dispatch` | Sub-agent delegation: TDD cycle, required spec elements, anti-patterns |
| `/help/lint` | Lint discipline: `make lint` is the gate, not per-method critiques |
| `/help/git` | Iceberg commits, CLI merges, reference commit sync |
| `/help/testing` | Scoped test runs, never the full Pharo suite |
| `/help/safety` | LibC deadlock prevention, image discipline, orphan recovery |
| `/help/makefile` | Image lifecycle: setup, start, stop, rebuild |
| `/help/lessons` | Incident record: cascades, process failures, scope safety |

The content is served from the live image at runtime, so it reflects the actual
loaded packages and the conventions that image was built with — not a static
documentation site.

## System in Action

A complete feature cycle — define a class, compile a method, run tests, commit —
using nothing but HTTP to the server.

```bash
# Agent reads the image's API and conventions before writing anything
curl -s http://localhost:8422/help/api
curl -s http://localhost:8422/help/pharo
```

```bash
# Define a class (Pharo 12 fluid syntax — server converts LF to CR automatically)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8422/repl \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "(Object << #Counter
  slots: { #count };
  package: 'MyPackage') install"
# → a Counter
```

```bash
# Compile a method — takes effect in the running image immediately
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8422/repl \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "Counter compile: 'increment
  count := (count ifNil: [0]) + 1' classified: 'actions'"
# → a CompiledMethod
```

```bash
# Run the tests — these exercise the live compiled method
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8422/repl \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "CounterTest buildSuite run"
# → 3 ran, 3 passed, 0 failures, 0 errors
```

```bash
# Lint gate — must be empty before commit
make lint 2>&1 | grep -v ': clean$' | grep -v '^$'
# (no output)
```

```bash
# Commit via Iceberg — from inside the running image
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8422/repl \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "| repo |
repo := IceRepository registry detect: [:r | r name = 'my-project'].
repo workingCopy refreshDirtyPackages.
repo workingCopy commitWithMessage: 'feat(counter): add increment'"
# → an IceCommit
```

The image stays live between steps. The agent can inspect live objects, browse class
hierarchies, query running servers, and call methods at any point in the cycle.

## Production Use

[`punt-labs/claude-agent-sdk-smalltalk`](https://github.com/punt-labs/claude-agent-sdk-smalltalk)
was developed using this workflow. That project ships five products for building
Claude agents in Pharo: an API client for the Claude Messages API, an in-image
agent tool runner, a Morphic GUI, and two integration layers. It currently has
199 classes, 2,358 methods, and 765 passing tests across approximately 32,000
lines of Smalltalk — all written, tested, and committed through Postern.

## Packages

## API Reference

### Eval server

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/repl` | `POST` | Evaluate Smalltalk (`text/plain` body). Returns `printString` of result. |
| `/health` | `GET` | Liveness check. Returns `ok`. No auth required. |
| `/help` | `GET` | Table of contents for the nine help sections. No auth required. |
| `/help/{section}` | `GET` | `api`, `pharo`, `dispatch`, `lint`, `git`, `testing`, `safety`, `makefile`, or `lessons`. |

**Binding and authentication:**

| Method | Binding | Auth |
|--------|---------|------|
| `PosternServer startOn: 8422` | loopback | none |
| `PosternServer startOn: 8422 withAuth: true` | loopback | required |
| `PosternServer startPublicOn: 8422` | all interfaces | required |

There is no unauthenticated public mode. When auth is enabled, `/repl` requires an
`X-Eval-Token` header; the token is written to `.tmp/eval-token`. `/health` and
`/help` are always unauthenticated.

**Line endings:** send LF. The server converts to CR before passing to the Pharo
compiler. `/help` responses use LF.

### Dashboard

Open from the World menu: **Postern > Dashboard**, or evaluate:

```smalltalk
PosternDashboard open.
```

Shows live traffic per server: method, path, status code, duration, body snippet.
The filter field takes keyboard focus on open. Multiple windows can monitor
different servers simultaneously.

### Iceberg sync

After CLI git operations, Iceberg's working copy reference commit can drift from
filesystem HEAD, showing a false "dirty" state. Fix it: right-click a repo in
the Iceberg browser → **Postern > Sync reference commit**. Or evaluate:

```smalltalk
repo workingCopy referenceCommit: repo head commit.
```

## Development

```bash
make rebuild     # fresh image from Tonel (proves source completeness)
make test        # run all Postern tests
make lint        # Renraku lint — zero non-clean lines required before commit
make filein      # reload Tonel packages into running image
make eval        # interactive Smalltalk eval (stdin to eval server)
make transcript  # read Pharo Transcript
make status      # health check — reports loaded class count
make stop        # kill Pharo (no save — image is disposable)
```

The image is disposable. All code lives in `src/` (Tonel format). `make rebuild`
must always succeed — if it fails, the source files are incomplete.
